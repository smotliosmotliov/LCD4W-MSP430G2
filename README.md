# LCD4W-MSP430G2
I am a little man with great dreams.
In wanting to learn to program, I will do a lot of crap, but I hope one day... to do something really useful. But for now...

This is my own driver for LCD display. This driver is writen on C language for MSP430G2553 microcontroller. The LCD controller is SED1278
